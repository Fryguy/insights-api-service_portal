# Swagger for Rails 5

This is a project to provide Swagger support inside the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework.

## Prerequisites
You need to install ruby >= 2.2.2 and run:

```
bundle install
```

## Getting started

This sample was generated with the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.

```
bin/rake db:create db:migrate
bin/rails s
```


## Force Puma to use another port

Puma ignores the `-p` flag with `bin/rails s`

```
env PORT=4000 rails s
```

## Rails server with SSL

Assuming port 3000

```
bin/rails s -b 'ssl://localhost:3000?key=config/ssl/localhost.key&cert=config/ssl/localhost.crt'
```

## Routes

To list all your routes, use:

```
bin/rake routes
```
